# Chore Tracker

This project is a very small static webpage that lets you track household chores and pay for them. It stores data in your browser so you can host it using GitHub Pages with no server required.

## Features

- Protect access to the tracker with a personal PIN.
- Add chores with individual pay rates.
- Mark chores as done and record when payments are made.
- Calculates the total amount owed for completed chores.
- All information is saved to your browser's local storage for persistence.

## Running with GitHub Pages

1. Commit the files in this repository to a GitHub repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and select the main branch as the source.
3. Navigate to the published GitHub Pages URL to use the tracker.

When you first open the site it will prompt you to create a PIN. After that the page will display the chore table. Data is stored locally so using the same browser will preserve your chores and payment records.
